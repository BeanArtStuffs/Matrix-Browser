# Matrix-Browser
A browser thingy I've spent a good few minutes on- not perfect- but it can display web pages, and thats all it needs! 


The MATRIX Browser is a really horrible way to use the internet, but its a thing nonetheless. I have another project that'll be a real working browser with a website and everything, but for now, this is what you get

You need Python 3.11 to run this, as all of the code was made in 3.11

--------------------------------PREREQUSITES--------------------------------------





To use the Matrix Browser, you need Git. It can be downloaded at https://git-scm.com/
You also need python 3.11. No other version will work. Python can be downloaded at https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/ or via the Microsoft Store.






------------------------------INSTALL AND USEAGE-----------------------------------








What you need to do after downloading the zip is to run the 'Patcher' batch file. 

Once all of those installs are done, it should close on its own. If it doesnt, just close it. 
Then, MATRIX should work! If it doesnt it could be my human error, or that you installed something wrong!

It has a rudermentary bookmarks system, and has little commands you can use, its nice! the UI is hard to read, sorry about that.

And yeah! thats about it!
