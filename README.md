# MATRIX-Browser
Hello! I don't really know why you'd want a browser that looks like the MATRIX (Not even) but alas, you're here. One thing to mention though, this is by no means a serious project or endorsed by literally anyone execpt me and MAYBE 1 other person. But without further ado, here are your instructions!

**DEPENDENCIES**

Before installing (preferably) anything in this little project, I would like to advise you to not be alarmed once you try and run the Manager, and get slapped with a Windows Defender popup. Still dont know why it does that...

But on to the REAL stuff! The amazing, wacky, wonderful little things called DEPENDENCIES!!!!
Theres alot to cover! (2 things to be exact, I know... so many things!!)

The first thing you ABSOLUTLEY need to have is Python 3.11. IT IS IMPERATIVE YOU HAVE PYTHON 3.11!! Without good ol' 3.11, I wouldnt have made this project, so yeah... you kinda need it! Python 3.11. and any other python version can be downloaded at Python.org, but our special little version can be downloaded [here]( https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)! OR, if you dont want a bajillion downloads (its just one dude...cmon...) you can get it on the Microsoft Store [here]( https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nrwmjp3717k?hl=en-US&gl=US ):
(I also reccomend getting other versions from here, mainly newer ones for my projects later into the future)

And the second AMAZING peice of software you NEED is Git! IF you dont know what Git is, it's an open source peice of software called a 'Version Control System' or VCS. What this does is tracks changes made over time to files, and even allows the user to revert to previous versions of said files! Pretty cool right? Well, if you want to update MATRIX at any time, you need Git! So hop on over to https://git-scm.com/ and get whatever newest version there is! 

And thats all the dependenices you need! Well... looks like it's time to get onto the

**INSTALL AND USAGE**

After Installing the dependencies, you can move on to the latest install by going to versions, and clicking on the current one. It should be something like 'V1.0.X' or if i do anything worthwile with this, 'V1.X.X' , And if I like devote my life to this, 'VX.X.X' and so on and so forth. If you've used github literally anywhere in any form, you know what the releases page is. 

Once you download the browser, navigate to the 'Matrix Manager' and follow the instructions there. It (hopefully should) prompt you with 5-6 options, one of them being the first and reading 'Install dependanices (On first installation)' or something simmilar. Run that, and if you've installed everything, feel free to use the MATRIX Browser to as little liking as you want!!! 

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

Please note that this is not supposed to be serious, as noted in the beggining, and was a little challenge I set out to do myself. This is not supposed to be a full release, either. This is meant solely for the fact that 'python can make a browser!!11!' and really no other use. It's buggy and a bit broken, but it doesnt need to be anything good, beacuse, lets be real. Theres NO WAY you'll ever use this as a main browser, nor will you ever use this for anything other than, idk, looking at its capabilites, or to just mess with it for 45 minutes on a break or something. I hope to make ACTUAL USEFUL software in the future and I hope that whoever downloads this sees this will realise its a joke, despite it taking me..3...weeks...but nevermind that, I hope you just enjoy MATRIX to it's fullest and have a good day/night!
